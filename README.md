# blink

Blink is a collection of libraries useful to facilitate development of games.
It is initially being used as a framework for exploring highly parallel game
systems based around breaking work down into asynchronous jobs.

All functions use a 'bl\_' prefix and types use 'BL' and preprocessor symbols use
'BL\_'.
